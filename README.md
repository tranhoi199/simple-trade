## Current Status
**Completion** :The core functionality has been implemented as per the requirements.

**Unit Testing**: I understand that a trading system requires comprehensive unit tests for reliability and maintainability. However, due to my current company's use of a different toolkit, I havenâ€™t been able to fully set up the unit tests for this project yet.
## Future Plans
If time permits, I plan to enhance this project by adding complete unit tests in the future to ensure robustness and coverage.
